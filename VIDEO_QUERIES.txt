## Video Structure

**Intro (2 min)**: Use queries 1-3 to show basic retrieval
**Middle (3 min)**: Use queries 4-5 to show analysis capability
**Memory Demo (2 min)**: Ask 1-3, then ask 8-9 to show memory working
**Complex (3 min)**: Use queries 13-14 to show advanced reasoning
**Close**: Show results and explain architecture

## Running the System

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

Then paste queries into the web interface and record.
